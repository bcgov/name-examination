## Names Examination Team Principles
The following is a list of principles that will help to guide our conduct and decisions as team through the names Examination project.
### Leverage of the CSI Lab Community
### Contribute to the Community
### Blue Sky – Everything is on the table, be open to new ideas and approaches
### Scent-free Workspace
### Plain Language/no jargon or explain jargon
### There are no Stupid Questions – Ask, talk, challenge, confirmation
### Real Time Documentation
### Seek/Gain decisions quickly – why and move on.  Can always be re-visited.
### Flexibility to alter course
### No Test (acceptance criteria), no commit
  -Product backlog (may not be fully articulated and should not be duplicates) & then pull in to sprint period – meant to committee to
  that and be realistic and not have a lot of work in progress, better to have a smaller level.
### Validate assumptions - No biases to new thought - Don’t allow existing structures & rules to influence what we’re trying to do 
  – develop a good product.  Which interfaces with next point
### Challenge Biases
### Identify organizational Impacts - favour experimentation over resolution.  Path Finder 
  - Risk capture (someone from security group that may see things that are issues – Ian & Carol), resulting in operational tweak’s.
### Trust/Transparency in the Community 
### Open Communication Model
### All project related things go in a repository – not on laptop.
